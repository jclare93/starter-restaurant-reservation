# Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System

A link to the live application can be found at https://restaurant-rez-client.herokuapp.com/dashboard  

So please give it a try. 

**Summary**
This is a restaurant reservation full-stack application. The purpose of the app is to be used by both customers, as well as business management. On the restaurant side, it allows management to view reservations, add/edit/remove tables, review past customers, place customers in their seat, and edit customer information.

On the customer side of things, it allows them to make reservations, edit their reservation, view their reservations, and even allows them to choose their seat. 
Of course this application also provides effective validation, accounting for things such as closing times and days off, whether there is enough people to fit at certain tables, etc. 


## Existing files

This repository is set up as a *monorepo*, meaning that the frontend and backend projects are in one repository. This allows you to open both projects in the same editor.

As you work through the user stories listed later in this document, you will be writing code that allows your frontend and backend applications to talk to each other. You will also write code to allow your controllers and services to connect to, and query, your PostgreSQL database via [Knex](http://knexjs.org/).

The table below describes the folders in this starter repository:

| Folder/file path | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./back-end`     | The backend project, which runs on `localhost:5000` by default.  |
| `./front-end`    | The frontend project, which runs on `localhost:3000` by default. |

This starter code closely follows the best practices and patterns established in the Robust Server Structure module.

**Note**: Please do not submit a pull request to this repository with your solution.

## Database setup

1. Set up four new ElephantSQL database instances - development, test, preview, and production - by following the instructions in the "PostgreSQL: Creating & Deleting Databases" checkpoint.
1. After setting up your database instances, connect DBeaver to your new database instances by following the instructions in the "PostgreSQL: Installing DBeaver" checkpoint.

### Knex

Run `npx knex` commands from within the `back-end` folder, which is where the `knexfile.js` file is located.

## Installation

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Run `cp ./back-end/.env.sample ./back-end/.env`.
1. Update the `./back-end/.env` file with the connection URL's to your ElephantSQL database instance.
1. Run `cp ./front-end/.env.sample ./front-end/.env`.
1. You should not need to make changes to the `./front-end/.env` file unless you want to connect to a backend at a location other than `http://localhost:5000`.
1. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
1. Run `npm run start:dev` to start your server in development mode.

If you have trouble getting the server to run, reach out for assistance.

## Running tests

This project has unit, integration, and end-to-end (e2e) tests. You have seen unit and integration tests in previous projects.
End-to-end tests use browser automation to interact with the application just like the user does.
Once the tests are passing for a given user story, you have implemented the necessary functionality.

Test are split up by user story. You can run the tests for a given user story by running:

`npm run test:X` where `X` is the user story number.

Have a look at the following examples:

- `npm run test:1` runs all the tests for user story 1 (both frontend and backend).
- `npm run test:3:backend` runs only the backend tests for user story 3.
- `npm run test:3:frontend` runs only the frontend tests for user story 3.

Whenever possible, frontend tests will run before backend tests to help you follow outside-in development.

> **Note** When running `npm run test:X` If the frontend tests fail, the tests will stop before running the backend tests. Remember, you can always run `npm run test:X:backend` or `npm run test:X:frontend` to target a specific part of the application.

Since tests take time to run, you might want to consider running only the tests for the user story you're working on at any given time.

Once you have all user stories complete, you can run all the tests using the following commands:

- `npm test` runs _all_ tests.
- `npm run test:backend` runs _all_ backend tests.
- `npm run test:frontend` runs _all_ frontend tests.
- `npm run test:e2e` runs only the end-to-end tests.

If you would like a reminder of which npm scripts are available, run `npm run` to see a list of available commands.

Note that the logging level for the backend is set to `warn` when running tests and `info` otherwise.

> **Note**: After running `npm test`, `npm run test:X`, or `npm run test:e2e` you might see something like the following in the output: `[start:frontend] Assertion failed:`. This is not a failure, it is just the frontend project getting shutdown automatically.

> **Note**: If you are getting a `unable to resolve dependency tree` error when running the frontend tests, run the following command: `npm install --force --prefix front-end`. This will allow you to run the frontend tests.

> **Hint**: If you stop the tests before they finish, it can leave the test database in an unusual state causing the tests to fail unexpectedly the next time you run them. If this happens, delete all tables in the test database, including the `knex_*` tables, and try the tests again.

### Frontend test timeout failure

Running the frontend tests on a resource constrained computer may result in timeout failures.

If you believe your implementation is correct, but needs a bit more time to finish, you can update the `testTimeout` value in `front-end/e2e/jest.config.js`. A value of 10000 or even 12000 will give each test a few more seconds to complete.

#### Screenshots

To help you better understand what might be happening during the end-to-end tests, screenshots are taken at various points in the test.

The screenshots are saved in `front-end/.screenshots` and you can review them after running the end-to-end tests.

You can use the screenshots to debug your code by rendering additional information on the screen.


### API


Our API follows RESTFUL principles. We have two main endpoints: /reservations and /tables. 
The /reservations endpoint allows you to get a list of all reservations by the date, create new reservations. The /reservations/:reservation_id endpoint allows us to get the information on any reservation(given a real id) and update that reservation as well. Finally the reservations/:reservation_id/status, allows you to change statuses from booked, to seated, to finished, which also will, in turn, change the status of tables.

The /tables endpoint allows us to get a list of all tables, whether they are free or occupied, and add more tables as well. The tables/:table_id/seat allows us to view and update whether a seat is currently occupied or not. Finally tables/:table_id, allows us to get information on a table, such as its status and capacity.

If you do have any errors with the API, you will get effective error messages, describing your issues and how to fix it. 

### Technology Used
This is a full stack application:

For the Backend: Node, Express, Postgres, and Knex.

For the Frontend: ReactJS, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
